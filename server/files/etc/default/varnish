# Configuration file for varnish

# Maximum number of open files (for ulimit -n)
NFILES=131072

# Maximum locked memory size (for ulimit -l)
# Used for locking the shared memory log in memory.  If you increase log size,
# you need to increase this number as well
MEMLOCK=82000

# Default varnish instance name is the local nodename.  Can be overridden with
# the -n switch, to have more instances on a single server.

# Listen on port 80, administration on localhost:6082, and forward to
# one content server selected by the vcl file, based on the request.  

# Use a 256 MB fixed-size cache file. 
# TODO figure out how to configure this so that the varnishd process 
# doesn't grow so large because we have little or no swap (or add
# more swap space)

# TODO pre-allocate the storage space using dd
